### This is my calculator project for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

The requirements for this project include creating a fully functional, simple calculator using Javascript, CSS, and HTML with emphasis on implementing JS functions. The calculator includes a simple UI, and can handle both button and keydown events.

This project taught me about using classes in JS and implementing functions/methods within the class to handle user input. I hope you enjoy!

Time spent: 12 hours.
